              <p>one of my favorite things to do is to workout and practice sports of any kind.I feel like doing sports help me focus and strucutre my day to day life and helps me clear my head if i've ever had a bad day. I also enjoy the discipline side of things,there is always something you can improve in the way you do a sport and i things that can relect on every aspect of life.
